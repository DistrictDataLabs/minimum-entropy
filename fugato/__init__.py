"""
The fugato app is designed to collect questions.

I'm not sure why this app is called Fugato, which is an Italian term for a
section of classical music. The term originated with Kyudo, but was never
exposed or properly explained. Other apps also carry classical music terms,
hopefully with explainations about why they're named the way they are.
